### Project 3: Foodmine

- **Description:** 
    Foodmine is a modern food ordering application developed using Angular for the front-end, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Inspired by the Glovo and Just Eat applications, Foodmine aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive platform to order food from various restaurants. Foodmine aims to revolutionize the food ordering experience by providing a user-friendly platform that connects customers with their favorite restaurants seamlessly. With its intuitive interface, secure payment processing, and real-time updates, Foodmine promises to deliver convenience and satisfaction to food enthusiasts everywhere.
- **Technologies Used:** 
    Angular: Front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
    Node.js: Backend JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
    MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and managing application data in a flexible and scalable manner.
    Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
    JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Project 4: Ulaznice.com

- **Description:** 
    This application offers users the purchase of tickets for all cultural and sports events. We decided on this topic because we were taught by our previous (negative) experiences when purchasing them. We are aware that today people rely more and more on contactless card payment, we are also aware of the economic and environmental aspects that this idea of ​​ours carries (primarily we mean saving resources during standard card printing).

    The cards are based on the contactless principle. When generating the map, a QR code is also generated which the readers at the gates of the corresponding institution/facility/hall/stadium would scan. Depending on whether the QR code is valid, the same readers would approve a person's entry to the desired event.

    Each user (buyer) of bi tickets has a separate profile on the site protected by a password chosen by the user. On the profile, in addition to the standard data required from the user (name and surname, bank account number, telephone and email contact), it is also possible to view all previous purchases that have been successfully completed.

    This is a Cross-Platform aplication because it was a University MVC Project that is later uppgraded to an Angular based application
- **Technologies Used:** 
    MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern used for designing and organizing applications. It divides an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.
      Model: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the data-related operations and provides an interface for accessing and manipulating data. In the context of web development, the Model typically interacts with the database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
      View: The View is responsible for presenting the application's user interface to the user. It displays the data from the Model to the user and captures user interactions. Views are usually implemented using HTML, CSS, and client-side scripting languages like JavaScript. In web applications, Views render the UI that users interact with in their browsers.
      Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives input from the user via the View, processes it using the appropriate logic from the Model, and updates the View accordingly. Controllers handle user requests, invoke the necessary actions on the Model, and determine which View to render. In web applications, Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests, routing, and business logic.
